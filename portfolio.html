 <p>I agree with the statement, "Computing will transform society." Computing has been a part of our daily lives now. Today we use computers to store a million data or even more.I think that this way, we are able to store as much things we want into a computer rather than when we didn’t which saves space in real life. It can be used to store our pictures, music, and other documents. 

Computing also has revolutionized the way our society communicates. It made communication as quick as a second by sending an email to someone or talking to your relative from another country through skype, and many other ways to reach people quickly. Communications through computers are good and can be beneficial but it can also be not used correctly or can be taken advantage of. Since its very easy to text someone through your phone, you can get used to talking to them on your phone rather than in real life if you do it too much and get used to it. 

Computers are also used to help us with calculating math problems that may take a while and with computers, it can crack it for you in just seconds making things faster for us.

    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>Lightbot is a fun challenging game that makes you program a robot in a way where it is like a puzzle or a problem. This game is like a computer in a way because it has command keys such as jump, move forward, or rotate. In a computer the command keys represent the inputs of being put into a computer like a mouse, a hard drive, or a keyboard. Next, the responses that the robot make on the game after you've selected a command key will make the robot do it as a result. For example if you click move forward, you will see that the robot will move forward. In a computer this is called an output. When you use a mouse, you can see that the cursor on the screen is moving in response to your hand's motion on the mouse. However, the difference between Lightbot and a computer is that Lightbot is just a simple programming website where basic commands are given to the robot, whereas a computer on the other hand has a lot of commands that makes it possible to do a lot of things. A computer is a more complex version of Lightbot.

    <p> It is a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written because it saves you more time to look for your error in small pieces rather than you having to look on a long piece.
	  </body>
	  
	     <p>Solving math problems are one of the things in life that require you to figure things out. Programming is similar to math problem solving because at the end of your work or solution, you may not have it right and so you have to go back and check what you did wrong and if it is a short problem then it’s easier to find your mistake, but if it’s a complicated problem, then it takes a while and you will probably need someone to help you check it. The difference between programming and solving a math problem is that programming can have different ways to fix it while in math you have one direct way.
</p>

    <p>A dual-core computer can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once by solving parts of the problem of one then after that it moves on to the other part of a different problem it from there it alternates the parts from each problem and that’s what makes it seems like it’s running one or more problem at a time.

    <h3> 1.1.4 Objects and Methods | Conclusion Questions</h3>
    
    <p>In a large project with hundreds of sprites and scripts, it might help to follow the convention that only one sprite will respond to a message and to follow our naming convention for messages
    because I think that if you try to do it  a different way other than the conventional one, 
    then I think it would create some errors to the program that might be harder to catch rather than when you use the conventional one.</p>
    
    <p>I think events are the result of what a user does like clicking a 
    mouse and handlers are the process that is used to make the event happen.</p>
    
    <p>a)some of the playG() method’s details that are encapsulated by the handler are the switching costume to sax playing the note at 67.</p>
    
    <p>b)I think the variations in play(G) that would be convenient to allow is the  sax playing and setting it back to sax quite after a certain amount 
    of seconds it wants it to play.</p>

    <h3>1.1.7 Game or Story | Create Task Part 2</h3>
    <p>This video illustrates the first level of me and my partner’s maze game. It shows how once you reached the red “stop” word, you will then be moved to the next level which is a harder version of the first one. 
    The purpose of our program is to be able to use a variable and other code strategies into our program. 
    Even though the variable “level” is hidden, every time we finished a level we add a variable with the level equaling to 1 at the start of the program. 
    We also used “if-else” statements inside of “if-else statements” to make the ball move with the use of the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.</p>
    
    <p>How our program works is that the ball would not move once “if” it touches the color of the maze which is set to black otherwise, “if” it doesn’t touch black, it will continue to move. 
    Also “if” it touches the stop sign which is the color red, it first add a variable to the level which then leads to “level 2” and have a harder level until it will keep adding 1 every time you finish a level and once it reaches the end level, 
    which is 3 the backdrop changes with the word, “finished.” and also hiding the ball. A pen is added next to the ball to track your previous route.

    <h3>1.2.2 Introducing App Inventor | Conclusion Questions</h3>
     <p> 1. The program in App Inventor being described partly in the GUI Designer and partly in the Blocks Editor is similar to Scratch because 
     Scratch also has this thing called a Script where the instructions within a Sprite is shown at. The information that is not shown in Scratch in the Scratch Scripts area is the GUI Designer part because it only shows the blocks.
     However you can find it as the Costumes in the Sprite’s menu</p>
     
     <p> 2. The opportunity for the average person to program will change society in the future by having more people to be able to invent and 
     create more programs rather than big companies creating these apps alone. This opportunity may spread to other people as well and it may eventually 
     become something normal to everyone and be part of our daily lives in the future.

    <h3>1.2.3 Creating Mobile Apps | Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>App inventor is similar to Scratch because they both allow users to create programs such as simple games or even complicated games. 
    The difference between the two is that for the App Inventor, it can be shown in another android device other than your computer. </p>
    
    <p>Design for a mobile device is different than design for a desktop or a laptop because there are certain more inputs that a mobile device has than a desktop or laptop. 
    A mobile device can have a touch screen while a laptop cannot. Another thing that a mobile device has that a laptop or a desktop doesn’t have is an accelerometer which 
    detects the rotation in which your mobile device rotates, horizontally or vertically.

     <h3> 1.3.2 Python Variables and Functions | Conclusion Questions</h3>
     
    <p>1. Something that I would like to have automated by a program is finding 
    each of the trigonometric functions of a given value function</p>
    
    <p>
2. The native data types that I learned in this activity are the type int
which are any integers and float, in which an integer has a decimal point or any real
number.
</p>
     
     <p>3. Some of the differences between the command line of the interpretive IPython session 
     and the code editor where you edit a file of code is that for the code editor, I think it lets 
     you define your argument while on the IPython, it is where you execute that command by 
     typing it and using the specific variable for it.</p>
     
     <p>
4. I think some of the advantages of putting code inside of a function definition is 1. It will be 
easy for you to find the code of that function easily, and 2. It will look very organized and it 
will probably help you find a bug faster.
</p>

    <h3>1.3.3 Branching and Output | Conclusion Questions</h3>
    
<p>1.The relationship between blocks of code indented after the colon in if, elif, 
and else blocks are that; for the code under the if statement will run if the condition is true, 
and so for elif and else, elif will be the opposite of the if statement and else would be the opposite 
of the elif statement.</p>

<p>2. There are many operators that can be used to create Boolean expressions. The ones that i’ve learned 
about are the “and” and “or.” One more Boolean operator that I searched on the Internet is the “not.”</p>

<p>3. I think Ira’s reasoning isn’t valid because I don’t think having to repeat the same line for each 
statement will slow down the program. I think Jayla’s reasoning is still not valid because if you put it
before the first statement, then I think it will be a constant and so it will be the first thing you see
once you run the program when you didn’t even type any variables in yet. I think Kendra’s reasoning is also
invalid because it is kind of the same as Ira’s and I think still think it won’t affect the speed of the
program.</p>
